# SIT223 UI Mock-up

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **UI mock-up** created for SIT223-SIT753 – *Professional Practice in IT*.  
It demonstrates a styled web page with a **Deakin-branded header** that includes the subject name and a logo aligned to the right.

## 🎨 Features & Techniques Used
- **HTML5** for page structure.  
- **CSS (main.css)** for styling:
  - Dark cyan header bar.  
  - Right-aligned Deakin logo.  
  - Centered text for subject title.  
- Clean, minimal design to match Deakin’s simple style guidelines.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Not fully **responsive** on all screen sizes (desktop view optimized).  
- Currently a **static page** – no JavaScript functionality.  
- Placeholder Deakin logo used – not official brand asset.
